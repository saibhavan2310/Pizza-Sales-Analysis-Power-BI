###Pizza Sales Analysis🍕

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of pizza sales, including requirements gathering, data analysis using SQL, and a detailed dashboard created in Power BI to visualize and understand sales trends and insights.

Project Overview
Requirements Gathering and Analysis
The project began with thorough requirements gathering to understand the business needs and objectives. Key stakeholders were consulted to identify the essential metrics and insights required to make data-driven decisions. The main objectives were:

To track and analyze total revenue.
To identify top-selling pizzas and their revenue contribution.
To understand sales trends over different time periods.
To compare sales performance across various dimensions like pizza type, size, and time.
Data Analysis in SQL
The analysis phase involved querying the sales data using SQL to extract, transform, and load (ETL) the necessary information. Key SQL tasks included:

Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
Calculating total revenue, total orders, and average order value.
Analyzing revenue by pizza type and size.
Identifying top-selling pizzas and peak sales times.
Comparing current and previous period sales to identify growth trends.
Power BI Dashboard
The insights derived from the SQL analysis were then visualized using Power BI. The dashboard includes interactive and dynamic visualizations to help stakeholders easily understand and explore the sales data. Key features of the Power BI dashboard:

Total Revenue: Displays the overall revenue generated within a specific period.
Total Orders: Shows the total number of orders placed.
Average Order Value: Calculates the average revenue per order.
Revenue by Pizza Type and Size: Breaks down revenue by different pizza types and sizes.
Top Selling Pizzas: Identifies the pizzas with the highest sales.
Revenue Trends: Line charts and bar charts showing revenue trends over days, weeks, and months.
Comparative Analysis: Compares current period revenue with previous periods to highlight growth trends.
Interactive Filters: Allows users to filter data by date, pizza type, size, and other dimensions for more detailed analysis.
