🍕 Pizza Sales Analysis
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of pizza sales, including requirements gathering, data analysis using SQL, and a detailed dashboard created in Power BI to visualize and understand sales trends and insights.

📋 Project Overview
📋 Requirements Gathering and Analysis
The project began with thorough requirements gathering to understand the business needs and objectives. Key stakeholders were consulted to identify the essential metrics and insights required to make data-driven decisions. The main objectives were:

📊 To track and analyze total revenue.
🏆 To identify top-selling pizzas and their revenue contribution.
📈 To understand sales trends over different time periods.
🔍 To compare sales performance across various dimensions like pizza type, size, and time.
🗄️ Data Analysis in SQL
The analysis phase involved querying the sales data using SQL to extract, transform, and load (ETL) the necessary information. The SQL analysis was divided into three levels of complexity: Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced.

Basic:

Retrieve the total number of orders placed.
Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales.
Identify the highest-priced pizza.
Identify the most common pizza size ordered.
List the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities.

Intermediate:
Join the necessary tables to find the total quantity of each pizza category ordered.
Determine the distribution of orders by hour of the day.
Join relevant tables to find the category-wise distribution of pizzas.
Group the orders by date and calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day.
Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue.

Advanced:
Calculate the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue.
Analyze the cumulative revenue generated over time.
Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue for each pizza category.
📊 Power BI Dashboard
The insights derived from the SQL analysis were then visualized using Power BI. The dashboard includes interactive and dynamic visualizations to help stakeholders easily understand and explore the sales data. Key features of the Power BI dashboard:

Total Revenue: Displays the overall revenue generated within a specific period.
Total Orders: Shows the total number of orders placed.
Average Order Value: Calculates the average revenue per order.
Revenue by Pizza Type and Size: Breaks down revenue by different pizza types and sizes.
Top Selling Pizzas: Identifies the pizzas with the highest sales.
Revenue Trends: Line charts and bar charts showing revenue trends over days, weeks, and months.
Comparative Analysis: Compares current period revenue with previous periods to highlight growth trends.
Interactive Filters: Allows users to filter data by date, pizza type, size, and other dimensions for more detailed analysis.
